# action-hash-verify

This is a first commit change.

Now this is a second commit change within ten seconds. Does action's push remain the same as "pushed" commit or latest head of branch?

* First commit action: https://github.com/RadWolfie/action-hash-verify/runs/676040788
* Second commit action: https://github.com/RadWolfie/action-hash-verify/runs/676042149

Since both commits were pushed within 10 seconds, they were not using the latest HEAD of the branch.
